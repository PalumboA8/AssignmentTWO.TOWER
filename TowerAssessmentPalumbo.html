		<h2>Step #2 </h2>
		<p>
			Overall, the webpage that holds the records of the Catholic University of America’s newspaper, The Tower, is a fantastic example of Nielsen's heuristics. The system is run and hosted through Jstor, which is an internationally recognized resource for researchers, students, and teachers to use for free. What JSTOR does well is in its simplicity. New users are instantly familiar with and able to navigate through the site’s simple and minimalistic design to find the results they need. Any user who has used other search engines such as Google or Bing would need very little introductory knowledge and assistance in using the site for their research needs. This is especially valuable for undergraduate students who do not have a history background but still need to write papers or do research for general education courses. This webpage is also extremely flexible, with specific categories that can be used to narrow down results for more in depth research. This would benefit teachers in particular because they often need incredibly specific material for their coursework. While the webpage does have many valuable assets, there are always ways it can be improved upon. One such way would be to improve the website’s error prevention. At the moment, it does very little to suggest different potential search options if you don’t type the correct thing. Also, upon a failed search, the webpage does not tell the user much beyond the fact that search failed. One potential solution would be an AI assistance tool like Google to help users find different types of information.

		<h2> Comparison Between Parts 1 and 2 </h2>
		<p>
			The usability test I conducted with my friend ended up having surprising results based on my heuristics examination. As someone who has spent alo of time working with websites like JSTOR, I thought it would be relatively easy for a novice to pick up the finer skills that are often necessary to search. To my surprise, the JSTOR system was not as intuitive as I had previously thought. While the user was able to access basic information about the topics in the short time that was given, they struggled to narrow down their results and find specific examples of what they needed. The simple design of the system allows users to make basic searches without an issue, but was not intuitive enough to encourage further research on their own. I would suggest increasing the size of the options bar on the side and simplifying it for an average user to use.
